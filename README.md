# Calculator

## Introduction

This project is an interface containing a simple and fully functional calculator. It doesn't have many complex operations, the interface contains digits 0-9, operations '+', '-', '/', 'x', a 'backspace' button (for clear), and an 'AC' button (for clear all). It is also allowed to operate using negative numbers (there is a '+/-' button that changes the sign of the number being entered).

The idea of ​​creating this interface was taken from [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). If you want to practice, there are excellent ideas there, I recommend it.

## Running

To facilitate the execution of this system, I suggest you have installed and configured [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Using your terminal, go to the root directory of that project and run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

After that, just access the URL "localhost:8888" in your browser.
